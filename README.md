# zapH

Chrome extention which allows you to see the text hidden on premium pages. Note I think you should buy a sub if you want the content. I only wrote it because I've never written an extension before and I wanted to see if it could be done.


Steps:

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file [here](https://github.com/buildsz/psychic-octo-sniffle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or via the download zip file from the bug green code button just up there on the right ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98428039/152918565-0ee12150-6380-41f6-a2b6-8cc10d1d3f8a.png)
3. If you downloade the zip file then extract it to a folder

or [here at developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) to load the extension in chrome. don't forget to enable it.

NB. this is very crude and could break at any time, probably making you very cross. If it breaks just buy the subscription it's probably cheaper than fixing it.
