Chrome extention which allows you to see the text hidden on premium pages. Note I think you should buy a sub if you want the content. I only wrote it because I've never written an extension before and it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Step:

1. Clone the repo
2. Follow these instructions here https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked to load the extension from source 
3. Enable it.

NB. this is very crude and could break at any time, probably making you very cross. If it breaks just buy the subscription it's probably cheaper than fixing it.
